      It was around 7/29/2013, I decided to give Jekyll a shot to make blog site. And it took me some time to figure out what to do, how to use the jekyll sutff.  And I decided to make a site you can fork and use it right away.  I am planning on making many different styles that can be run properly with github pages.

      I assume you already have installed the jekyll and followed their instructions.
      If not, please follow <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">this instruction</a> and come back.
    </p>

      I am still the beginner at jekyll and github page. (ugh... today is 2013-08-07)  So, if anyone has better ideas or suggestions, please help me! :-)   I will continue to add more stuff to this site.
    </p>

    <p>
      In this site, I have prepared
      <ul>
        <li>config files for development and production</li>
        <li>how to run dev config settings from your local</li>
        <li>menu</li>
        <li>templates</li>
        <li>jquery accordion</li>
        <li>jquery menu</li>
        <li>post samples</li>
        <li>pagination</li>
        <li>markdown formats</li>
        <li>some quick instructions on each section</li>
        <li></li>
        <li></li>
      </ul>
